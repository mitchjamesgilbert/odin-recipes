  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Think of these beef and chorizo empanadas as a kind of South American 
    pasty. They can be baked or fried and are tasty served with guacamole and 
    sour cream</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>375g plain flour</li>
    <li>220g chilled butter, chopped</li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>300g beef mince</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>½ small pack parsley, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Tip the flour into a bowl with 1 tsp salt and add the butter. Rub the 
      butter and flour with your fingertips until crumbly. Add the eggs and 
      100ml cold water, bring together to a dough then turn out onto a floured 
      surface and begin to knead until soft and smooth. Cover with cling film 
      and put in the fridge to rest for 20 mins.</li>
    <li>Remove the chorizo from its casing and add to a mixing bowl with the 
      mince, onion, coriander, parsley, paprika, cumin and chilli flakes. Mix 
      everything together, then cook in a frying pan over a medium heat for 
      2 mins. Add the tomato purée and cook for a further 7-10 mins until 
      everything is cooked through. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.</li>
    <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Divide the dough into four 
      portions and roll out each one into a thin sheet. Use a 10cm biscuit 
      cutter to cut out discs. Place 1 tsp of filling in the centre of each 
      disc, wet the edges, pinch both sides up and fold in half to seal. Use 
      a fork to crimp the edges.</li>
    <li>Arrange on a lined baking tray, brush with beaten egg and bake for 
      20 mins. When the empanadas are ready, remove from the oven and cool for 
      5 mins before serving.</li>
