    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Put the chicken, corn cobs, garlic, onion, pepper, potatoes, spring 
        onions and coriander in a pan with 2 litres water and bring to the boil, 
        season well, then simmer for approximately 45 mins over a medium 
        heat.</li><br>
      <li>Remove the corn and the chicken and transfer them to a plate. 
        Blend the remaining ingredients in the pan with a hand blender until 
        you get a creamy consistency.</li><br>
      <li>Add the papas criollas and the guascas to the pan and cook over a 
        medium heat for around 10-12 mins, or until the papas criollas start to 
        get soft but do not disintegrate.</li><br>
      <li>Meanwhile, shred the chicken breasts finely with your hands, and cut 
        the corn cobs into thick slices. Put into separate small bowls.</li><br>
      <li>Put the cream, capers, avocado and extra chopped coriander in small 
        bowls as well, so that everyone can help themselves to what they want. 
        Pour the soup into four soup bowls and serve alongside the other 
        ingredients. Don’t forget napkins for eating the slices of corn.</li><br>
