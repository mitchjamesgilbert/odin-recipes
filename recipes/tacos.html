      <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 mins 
        until softened. Sprinkle over the spices and cook for 1 min more. 
        Add the mince, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon, and stir 
        until cooked through.</li><br>
      <li>Stir the passata and barbecue sauce into the pan along with 4 tbsp 
        water. Increase the heat and allow the sauce to bubble and reduce until 
        it clings to the meat. Add the beans, season and cook for a further 2 
        mins, then stir in the coriander. Heat the tacos following pack 
        instructions.</li><br>
      <li>Use the pork and bean mix to fill the tacos, top with slices of 
        avocado, shredded iceberg lettuce and a dollop of soured cream, if 
        you like.</li><br>
